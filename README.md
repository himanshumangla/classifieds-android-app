# Classifieds-Web-App
This is a working prototype of Campus specific classifieds android app, developed for I-MADE app-a-thon, held in association with Dept. Of Telecommunication, Govt. Of India, at IGDTUW, Kashmere Gate. It is simply a hybrid app developed from the web app using apache cordova platform, ditching native android development.

The web app was made using HTML, CSS, JS and the backend handled using php scripts and SQL on XAMPP server.
This prototype can be used to venture into the so far uncaptured classifieds sector, specifically in higher educatioon schools, within and outside of India.
